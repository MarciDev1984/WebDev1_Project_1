    <h2>Takao Project</h2>
    <p>I was the lead developer for the Takao Project, an independent coding project founded by several friends of mine.
      The Takao Discord bot was a chat application designed to add an interactive entertainment experience to Discord, a
      chat application. The bot was used in over 500,000 discord servers at its peak, and lasted for nearly 3 years
      before its eventual demise. My major contribution to the project was twofold, overhaul core parts of the
      experience and take over active maitenence of the project. My first major overhaul came to the Companion system, a
      pokemon-lite minigame that allowed users to battle each other with their pets. I signifigantly improved the
      overall design of the game, adding a food and health system as well as an experience system that allowed users to
      improve their skills while fighting. During this portion of the project I also opened up the strings inside the
      game to localization, allowing it to be completely unique for over a dozen different lanugages.</p>
