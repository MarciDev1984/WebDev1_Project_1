          <p>I am a board game fan, and have a decent collection of over 30 unique games. I am also the president of
            Northwest
            Gaming, my University's game club. I have run the yearly convention TowerCon, a weekend of gaming for the
            community, for the past three years. One of my personal favorite board games is called Azul. It's a tile
            placement
            board game where the goal is to complete a beautiful tile floor.</p>

          <p>I am also a huge hockey lover, having followed the St. Louis Blues, my hometown team, since my childhood.
            Some
            of
            my earliest memories are of hockey games I attended with my father. I have since grown my fandom to inclue
            the
            sport as a while, currently i'm cheering for five seperate NHL teams in addition to the Blues.</p>
